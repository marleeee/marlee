  <h3>Skills & Abilities</h3>
    <p>
      I have great people skills and a large amount of patience. I am
      great at multitasking. For example, when I am playing basketball for
      my school, I manage to keep my 3.9 and rising GPA up and my grades
      never suffered once. Also, I participate in many clubs such as
      National Honor Society, Caribbean club, Science Club, and the
      Student Government Association as acting President for the class of
      2019. After graduating highschool I was enrolled as a full time student
      with two places of employment at once. With having both my jobs in
      customer service, I developed great patience for all different
      types of buyers, customers, and guests.
